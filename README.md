## What is this project
Produces a static web page app that highlights work by Code by Dex.  It is used to showcase new skills learned throughout the boot camp. 

## Why
It allows others to see what Code by Dex is doing and learning at bootcamp. 

## How
You can access the site at: https://code.bydex.co/

To use this site you need to download the repo and then run it using your preferred local web hosting method. 

The site contains a wireframe page used for troubleshooting layouts and working through modeling issues before applying them into the main project solution.

You can enable the framing on the main project by including the frame.css file. 

## Where
If you have questions about this project please reach out to Code by Dex on github. 

## Who
This project is meant just for Code by Dex but others are welcome to use it for insperation on their own projects. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
